		<p>Quality Insight consists of indicators that address the quality measures in a variety of Federal programs such as Meaningful Use, Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR), and VAlue Based Purchasing (VBP).</p>
<p>The Concurrent Insightâ„¢ (CI) solution allows hospitals to impact the quality of patient care while the patient is still in the bed. The solution also alerts quality staff to gaps in care and documentation that could cause harm and loss of revenue from federal programs. CI is divided into three care groups:<br /><br />Quality Insight consists of indicators that address the quality measures in a variety of Federal programs such as Meaningful Use, Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR), and Value Based Purchasing (VBP). These same indicators are used by The Joint Commission in their certification and accreditation requirements.<br /><br />Quality Insight helps hospitals to proactively identify patients who may fall into one of these indicators, before the assignment of a final diagnosis. They are then able to review the care given to these patients during their stay and be alerted to gaps in care or documentation that could impact outcomes or measured performance.<br /><br />Nursing Practice Insight targets practices in a hospital that have the potential for complications which can be costly to the hospital. These costs result from poor outcomes for patients, loss of payer reimbursement, and poor performance on Federal measures.<br /><br />Nursing Practice Insight enables a hospital to track patients who have certain types of care, such a central line, or patients who have been identified as being at a higher risk for an adverse event like a pressure ulcer. These indicators enable the staff responsible for oversight of these patients to see that they are getting the proper care in a timely manner or, more importantly, to see when patients are not receiving the desired standard of care and take appropriate corrective action.<br /><br />Patient Safety Insight enables the quality staff at a hospital to monitor and react to adverse events. These indicators have been created using industry best practices and published clinical research to identify lab results, medications, and procedures that might indicate that a negative event has happened to a patient. With this knowledge the quality staff can respond and ensure that proper follow-up care and documentation has been provided for the patient. This enables a hospital to mitigate the consequences of a negative event, improve patient outcomes, and save money for the hospital.</p>	</section>
